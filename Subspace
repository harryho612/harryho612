1 code to rule them all:

Before running a node make sure that your system clock is synchronized - this is important. On Ubuntu 20.04 the system clock should be synchronized by default. To verify, run the following command and check the output
    timedatectl | grep "System clock"
Output: 
    System clock synchronized: yes
If the output is different, then you can install NTP manually and verify again that your system clock is synchronized:
    apt install ntp
    ntpq -p
